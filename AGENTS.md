# AGENTS.md — conventions for AI agents working in this repo

If you're an LLM (or an LLM-driven editor) about to make changes here, read
this first. This is **TermForge**, a modular terminal UI framework in C++23
(BSD 3-clause). The full design rationale lives in the project gameplan; this
file is the tactical version.

## Baseline (keep in sync if changed)

- **CMake ≥ 3.28**, **C++23** (GCC 13+ / Clang 19+).
- **Compiler respects the environment** by default; clang is an opt-in
  toolchain (`cmake/toolchain/clang.cmake`), like the sanitizer toolchains.
- **Catch2 v3** for tests (`FetchContent`). **Stdlib-only at runtime** — no
  third-party deps in the shipped library.
- **Compiled static library** (`src/lib/`), not header-only.
- **`project(termforge)` is hardcoded**, not derived from the directory name,
  and `termforge_{TESTS,EXAMPLES,BIN,INSTALL}` all default to
  `PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL` — a consumer gets `termforge::lib` and nothing else.
  Never spell `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` in termforge's own paths (it is the
  *consumer's* root under `add_subdirectory`); use `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`.
  `tools/consume/run.sh` is the acceptance test for both consumption paths.

## Hard rules (project-specific)

- **Drivers emit bytes verbatim.** Escape sanitization (strip C0/C1/ESC from
  user/network text) happens in the **renderer**, never the driver. If you add
  a text path, keep this split — it's the injection defense.
- **Degradation is an event.** Any fallback/downgrade returns/raises an
  `ErrorEvent` via `std::expected` — never silently downgrade. The two
  severities the library actually emits mean different things, and the
  distinction is load-bearing rather than a gradient of loudness:
  **`Info`** — the request was honoured by a lesser route. The app got what it
  asked for and should know the tier changed (`detail/keyboard.hpp`: no kitty
  keyboard protocol, so the legacy encoding is used, and every key still
  arrives).
  **`Warning`** — the request was *not* honoured and nothing was drawn or
  emitted (every `draw_image` guard: empty image, empty destination rect, a
  payload format this tier cannot decode). A caller that ignores it has a hole
  in its UI.
  `Severity` defaults to `Info` on the `ErrorEvent` aggregate, which is a
  default rather than a recommendation — pick deliberately.
  **Sanctioned exception — `AppRequirements` (#91).** An app may declare a
  structured floor (`graphics`, `truecolor`, key press/repeat/release, min
  cell grid, optional known/minimum cell-pixel extent) via `App::require`.
  Default is empty (degrade as today). Evaluation is a pure function of the
  declared value plus selected-driver, keyboard-mode, probe, size and
  cell-geometry facts, run after driver selection and cell-geometry setup but
  **before `enter_screen()`**. Reported sixel does not satisfy `graphics` until
  a selected SixelDriver can actually carry it; repeat/release requires the
  effective input route to provide it (kitty terminal support plus
  `KeyboardMode::Enhanced`, or a structured `EventSource` declaration).
  Startup refusal is
  `Severity::Error`; raw mode is unwound and the diagnostic lands on the normal
  screen. A live resize or keyboard-mode change below the floor emits a
  requirements-transition `ErrorEvent`, latches
  `requirements_met() == false`, and suppresses enhanced image submission until
  restored — the framework does **not** invent a modal. Unknown cell geometry
  fails only when geometry was required.
- **Every frame is metered, and the meter is per-driver** (#139, #147). A
  driver's `flush()` calls `tally_frame(written)` exactly once with the byte
  count it handed to the sink; image paths call `tally_image_transmit` /
  `tally_image_edit` as they append. `cells` is the *remainder*, never tallied
  directly, so the buckets sum to what was emitted by construction and a new
  escape path can be miscategorised but never lost. The counters are instance
  state — one driver is one session, and a `static` here makes a server unable
  to bill any single connection. If you add an emit path that is image traffic,
  tally it; if you add one that is not, it is already counted.
- **Image residency is committed at the same accepted-write boundary** (#112).
  `ImageResidency` reports a driver's belief, never invented terminal capacity:
  region-cache and pinned counts plus the exact source payload bytes believed
  resident (compressed input bytes for opaque payloads, not decoded memory). Kitty
  stages ordered, generation-qualified mutations because one frame may evict
  and reuse an id; `emit_frame` acceptance commits them, sink refusal discards
  them, and a later Kitty rejection/timeout invalidates or restores the relevant
  belief. The ledger is per-driver instance state. `invalidate_images` clears it
  without wire, while an accepted shutdown delete-all clears it with wire.
  **That boundary covers the complete Kitty image transaction** (#313): raw
  and opaque region content, placement state, initial pins, replacements,
  partial edits, animations and their reply correlations are all projected
  until the frame write is accepted. Sink refusal restores the last committed
  hashes, revisions, placements and residency, drops only correlations created
  by the unwritten frame, releases staged transport resources, and invalidates
  a new pin/animation handle whose upload never reached the terminal. Never
  retain a borrowed payload merely to manufacture an automatic retry; App
  re-borrows widget-owned content on its next production frame.
- **Indirect image transport is explicit embedding policy** (#111). Never
  infer a shared filesystem/shm namespace from `TERM`, SSH variables, a tty,
  or an emulator name. `TerminalDriver::set_image_transport` is base-owned
  non-virtual state; no strategy means Kitty's historical direct `t=d` wire.
  The shipped `PosixSharedMemoryTransport` is opt-in and applies only to
  initial region and pinned-image `a=t` uploads — animation frames, root
  replacements and partial edits keep their action-specific direct paths. A
  staged resource stays owned through the ordered terminal reply. Strategy
  failure falls back direct with one `Info`; terminal rejection releases the
  resource, retries direct with one `Info`, and latches direct for that driver
  session. Sink refusal, timeout, invalidation and explicit retirement release
  the lease. Meter only the short indirect command handed to the sink, while
  residency continues to count the exact source payload bytes.
- **`emit_frame` is the write boundary AND the meter boundary** (#178). They
  are one function on `TerminalDriver` precisely so that "sent but not metered"
  and "metered but not sent" are both unspellable — a driver's `flush()` is
  `emit_frame(m_buf)` plus its own buffer reset, and `emit_frame` calls
  `tally_frame` itself. `set_output` is **base-owned non-virtual state**, so it
  is reachable through the `unique_ptr<TerminalDriver>` an application actually
  holds; do not re-declare it on a driver (C++ hides by *name*, so a subclass
  copy makes the `ByteSink*` overload invisible). The limitation is real and
  tested: a driver that emits without going through `emit_frame` opts out of
  the sink *and* the meter at once — `test/support/bypass_driver.hpp` pins it.
  **Synchronized output is bounded at that same boundary** (#269): a frame
  whose payload plus `CSI ? 2026 l` exceeds the one-MiB pending transaction
  budget is emitted whole and unwrapped in the same single write, metered as
  emitted, and reports the lesser route once as `Severity::Info`. The
  capability stays enabled so a later small frame is wrapped normally. Never
  split a frame or an escape sequence to force it under the budget, and never
  turn one oversized frame into a permanent session downgrade.
  An output refusal is latched, not returned (`flush()` is pure and `-> void`,
  and giving it a return type would break every out-of-tree driver), and `App`
  drains it into an `ErrorEvent` each frame. The stdout route is fallible too
  (#304): a short `fwrite`, failed `fflush` or resulting stream error refuses
  the frame at the same boundary as a `ByteSink`. **Cell and rendition shadows commit
  at that accepted-write boundary too** (#303): `Renderer::flush()` invalidates
  its staged cell baseline after refusal, and built-in drivers invalidate their
  projected cursor/SGR state, so an identical retry emits a complete repair.
  The private base-owned acceptance bit does not consume the diagnostic, and a
  driver that bypasses `emit_frame` opts out of this observation along with the
  sink and meter. **The sink is borrowed, never
  owned**, which is why end-of-session cleanup goes through explicit
  `TerminalDriver::shutdown()` while the sink is known alive; destructors do
  not emit — see #148 and #144 row 7. **State, not behaviour, means base-owned
  non-virtual data** — that has now been the right answer twice, here and for
  `Terminal::set_io` below, so treat it as settled rather than re-arguing it the
  third time. It sidesteps the pure/non-pure question instead of answering it.
  **Frame timing observes that same boundary** (#258). `App` arms private,
  base-owned timing only when a frame observer is installed; disabled telemetry
  performs no clock reads. One observation follows each rendered frame's one
  write and accepted-write bookkeeping, never a demand-idle iteration. Its byte
  count is what was handed to the sink even on refusal, paired with an explicit
  acceptance bit. `sink_write` is only the blocking `ByteSink::write` (or
  stdout) handoff — never terminal decoding or presentation — and the timing
  clock is real steady wall time, not `SyntheticClock` simulation time.
- **Runtime polymorphism for drivers** (`std::unique_ptr<TerminalDriver>`);
  the `DriverImpl` concept is a `static_assert` check only, not dispatch.
  Don't convert drivers to a closed `std::variant`.
- **Screen spill identities are never reused, and reclamation is a mark/sweep
  boundary** (#305). `Screen::at()` exposes mutable `Cell&`, so a caller may
  copy a token between cells without an interceptable reference-count update.
  Keep process-unique monotonic tokens: a reclaimed id left in a Renderer
  shadow must cause a conservative mismatch, never false equality with later
  text. Superseded spill strings are collected after `Renderer::present()`
  has resolved the current frame, and allocation pressure also sweeps Screen-
  only churn; every sweep marks the complete live cell grid before erasing.
- **Capability detection queries the terminal**, never the display server. Pin
  capability *requirements*, never emulator version numbers.
- **Pixel destinations are named in cells, never in pixels** (#83).
  `draw_image` takes a `Rect` of cells and each driver resolves the scale
  natively; a widget that rasterizes renders to the `Extent` the driver hands
  it via `preferred_pixel_extent`, and asks `image_cell_extent` rather than
  re-deriving a footprint from capability flags — a new tier implements one
  function and gets the rest right for free. `draw_pixels` returns a borrowed
  `const Image*` the *widget* owns, one buffer per declared region. **App's
  enhanced image pass is Kitty + ANSI truecolour, not every driver with a
  `draw_image` implementation** (#108): FallbackDriver's luminance ramp exists
  for direct callers, while a widget's authored `draw()` cells remain its
  information-complete Baseline. Both region collection and `on_pixels` use the
  same gate; do not widen one without the other.
  **`PixelSurface` owns a fixed logical pixel grid** (#195). Cell geometry only
  changes its destination; `reset` is the explicit storage-resize boundary.
  Its ASCII draw is the information-complete Baseline, while App carries the
  widget's `pixel_placement` into the enhanced draw and turns a driver refusal
  into an `ErrorEvent`. Since #197 it is a Persistent region: mutable access and
  `invalidate` mark content dirty, App pins/replaces Kitty content and skips
  clean ANSI rasterization, movement is placement-only, and the producer is
  acknowledged only after the frame's sink write is accepted. Persistent
  region identity is `(Widget*, pixel_regions vector index)`, never its Rect;
  keep the vector order stable while a region lives.
  **Reported cell geometry is distinct from a rendering fallback** (#143).
  `TerminalDriver::reported_cell_pixel_size()` is base-owned, non-virtual
  session state and returns `std::expected`: a positive measurement is a value,
  while an absent/partial terminal report is a `Warning`, never Kitty's nominal
  8x16 presented as fact. `ResizeEvent` appends an optional measured `Extent`;
  a pixel-only change with an unchanged grid still travels through the one
  resize path before rendering. Keep old two-field aggregate initialization
  valid, and keep schemas 1-7 readable with that appended value unknown.
  **Image stacking is semantic placement state** (#114). `ImageLayer` maps
  `above_text(rank)`, `below_text(rank)` and `below_background(rank)` onto the
  Kitty signed z domain; rank zero is nearest the named boundary, and `raw(z)`
  is the explicit protocol escape hatch. The below-background start literal is
  defined only in `core/types.hpp` and guarded by a source scan -- drivers use
  `z_index()`, never repeat it. `ImagePlacementOptions` is the additive home
  for fit, layer and #115's pixel placement fields. Its driver overloads stay
  non-pure, and the default z=0 wire stays byte-identical (omit `z=`). App asks
  `supports_image_placement` before borrowing/blanking a widget region; an
  unsupported request keeps the authored Baseline and emits one transition
  `Info`. Placement options are complete cached/resident state, so a layer-only
  change re-places without retransmitting. A pinned placement's Classic key is
  `(image id, Rect)`, permitting exact overlap of distinct images; Unicode
  placeholders cannot represent that collision and refuse it with a `Warning`.
  **Kitty Rect identity is lossless** (#314). Region slots, pending opaque-reply
  correlations, resident placements and same-frame collision guards compare
  every accepted `Rect` field at its full signed-`int` width. Hash collisions
  are ordinary container collisions because equality remains exact; never pack
  or narrow the fields to manufacture an identity. If a future tier cannot
  represent a rectangle, validate and return `Warning` before cache lookup,
  mutation or wire instead of aliasing it.
  **Sub-cell placement and source crops are placement state** (#115).
  `pixel_offset` is non-negative and strictly inside one current cell;
  `source` is a positive `PixelRect` wholly inside the real `Image` extent or
  the caller-declared `EncodedImage`/pin extent. Validate both before cache
  lookup, mutation or wire, with 64-bit intermediate arithmetic; never parse an
  opaque payload to check its declaration. The selected crop is the effective
  `Exact` extent and its pixel offset counts toward the containing cell rect.
  Kitty Classic emits `X=`/`Y=` and `x=`/`y=`/`w=`/`h=` only when requested,
  so the default wire remains byte-identical. Geometry changes re-place
  without retransmitting. **Do not emit those fields on a virtual placement:**
  Kitty stores them but its Unicode-placeholder renderer reconstructs from the
  full root image and ignores them, exposing neighboring atlas sprites.
  Unicode placeholders therefore report no support for geometry or `Exact`,
  and direct calls refuse with a `Warning`; App keeps the authored Baseline and
  transition-latches the supported-lesser-route `Info` before blanking cells.
  Other tiers refuse these fields with the same honest split.
- **A pre-encoded payload is shipped verbatim** (#163). `EncodedImage` carries
  opaque bytes the *terminal* decodes; the library never encodes, decodes,
  inspects or resamples them — that is the application's asset pipeline's job,
  and it is the only reason a compressed wire format can exist here without
  breaking the stdlib-only rule. Never add a check that requires parsing the
  payload: `Rgba32` and `Rgb24` lengths are derivable and validated at four and
  three bytes per pixel respectively; `Rgba32Zlib` and `Png` are opaque and
  deliberately are not. `Rgb24` is Kitty-only `f=24` packed opaque RGB; flat
  tiers refuse it rather than inventing a sampler. `Rgba32Zlib` is
  caller-compressed and rides Kitty as `f=32,o=z`; TermForge never links zlib
  or offers a codec helper. #169 sharpened rather than weakened this — the declared
  extent is precisely *why* no parse is needed, and a guard built on it stays
  inside the rule. A tier that cannot carry a format says so via
  `supports_image_format` *and* returns a `Warning` — never a guess.
  **Widget pixel regions carry that same payload without decoding** (#167).
  `draw_encoded_pixels` is queried before `draw_pixels`; non-null means the
  encoded route was chosen, so invalid or unsupported bytes preserve the cell
  Baseline and report the degradation instead of silently falling through to
  raw pixels. App borrows both the descriptor and its nested span. Persistent
  identity includes raw/encoded kind, encoded format and declared extent;
  opaque initial pins keep the Baseline until terminal `OK`, while replacements
  keep the last accepted root visible. Delayed acknowledgements are qualified
  by `PixelRegionState::content_revision` so an old reply cannot clear newer
  dirty content.
- **Scaling is the default, not the only option** (#137). Stretch-to-fill is
  right for content a widget *generates*, because it can re-rasterize at
  `preferred_pixel_extent`. `PlacementFit::Exact` is for content the app
  *ships*, where the pixel grid carries meaning and a non-integer resample is a
  silent corruption rather than a quality loss. `supports_placement_fit`
  answers before anything is drawn, and its answer can change at runtime.
  `Exact` anchors top-left and refuses an image that does not fit; it is not a
  fit mode and adds no border policy. Since #169 it applies to `EncodedImage`
  too — a pre-rendered plate is by definition pre-encoded, so the two features
  had to compose or neither was usable for shipped art. There the fit is
  enforced against the caller-**declared** extent, for every format: it is the
  only number that exists, and `s=`/`v=`, the content hash and
  `image_cell_extent(Extent)` already rest on it. Still nothing parses the
  payload.
- **Opaque image success is acknowledged, not assumed** (#165). `Input`
  recognizes Kitty graphics APC replies as terminal control-plane records and
  never turns them into application `Event`s; `App` offers them to the selected
  driver's non-pure `consume_reply` hook before ordinary input, even while an
  `EventSource` replaces terminal keystrokes. Raw RGBA and RGB remain locally
  validated and fully quiet. Opaque PNG and Rgba32Zlib transfers use `q=2` on
  intermediate chunks and `q=0` on the final chunk, and Kitty commits their
  content hash only after the correlated `i=` reply says `OK`. Synchronous API
  success means only "validated and queued"; an opaque pin's handle cannot
  draw, retain or replace until its initial `OK`. A rejection is a `Warning`
  and rolls back the relevant belief: a region retries, a rejected pin becomes
  stale, and a rejected root edit preserves its last accepted frame. Only one
  operation may await an id; different work refuses without mutation. After
  120 driver flushes an unanswered operation warns, rolls back and quarantines
  the id until its late reply arrives, so a stale acknowledgement can never
  bless a later image that inherited the number. Trace schema 4 records
  normalized replies for replacement-source sessions; schemas 1–3 remain
  readable.
- **A virtual an out-of-tree driver could not have implemented is never pure.**
  Third-party drivers are a stated extensibility goal, so a new pure virtual
  breaks every one of them at compile time on upgrade. #163 and #137 each add a
  NON-pure overload with an honest default — delegate where there is something
  correct to delegate to, otherwise a `Warning`. Nothing else in the tree
  derives from `TerminalDriver`, so CI cannot see this on its own: every such
  addition also extends `test/support/legacy_driver.hpp`'s case, and "make the
  virtual pure" is then a mutation that fails to *compile*. Do not give the new
  overload a default argument either — it would be ambiguous against the
  existing one at every call site, and defaults on virtuals bind statically.
  **#109 is where the state-vs-behaviour rule above answered *behaviour*, so do
  not re-argue it in the wrong direction.** Pinning emits protocol and holds
  terminal-side memory, which only a tier with an out-of-band channel can do at
  all — per-tier variance *is* the content of the feature, which is exactly the
  case this rule exists for. Base-owned data was right for `set_output` and
  `set_io` because there was nothing to vary. What is base-owned here is the
  handle *type* and the non-virtual Stretch convenience, nothing more.
- **An image's lifetime and a placement's lifetime are separate** (#109), and on
  the kitty wire the difference is one letter. `a=d,d=I` frees the image data
  *and* its placements; `a=d,d=i` retires one placement and leaves the data
  resident. A region owns its image and takes the first; a pinned placement does
  not own the image it shows and must take the second. Reaching for `d=I` on a
  structure that does not own its image deletes a stranger's data — and does it
  silently, because `q=2` means the terminal's objection reaches nobody.
- **Mutable resident content edits the root frame; it does not retransmit the
  image** (#196). A normal `a=t` under an existing id invalidates the image's
  placements, so `replace_pinned` uses `a=f,r=1,X=1` to replace root-frame data
  under the stable id. **Every chunk stays an edit of root frame 1** (#261):
  animation continuations repeat both `a=f` and `r=1`. Repeating only the
  documented action lets Kitty decide “new frame” from the continuation's
  default `r=0` before it restores the opener, so the transfer succeeds into
  frame 2 while the live placement remains on frame 1. Extent and wire format
  are immutable for the handle: a mismatch is a `Warning` emitted before wire
  or hash state changes, preserving the last successful frame. The payload
  remains subject to the same raw-length and opaque-encoded rules as
  `pin_image`.
- **Partial resident edits stay partial** (#140). `edit_pinned` targets a live
  `PinnedImage` with a `PixelPoint` offset, a raw or encoded block and explicit
  alpha/overwrite composition. `Rect` remains cells; never reuse it for pixel
  coordinates. Kitty emits `a=f,r=1,x=,y=,s=,v=` and `X=1` only for overwrite,
  keeps every placement live, and repeats `a=f,r=1` on continuations. Validate
  the complete block inside the declared root extent before wire or state.
  Other tiers return a `Warning`; a silent full retransmit changes the requested
  bandwidth class and is not a fallback. The whole command, including payload,
  is `image_edit`, never `image_transmit`. Accepted edits add their exact source
  payload bytes to residency and make the full-frame hash unknown; sink refusal
  discards both, while opaque rejection/timeout restores the prior belief.
- **Animation registration creates frames; it never edits them** (#116).
  `register_animation` validates the complete borrowed sequence before wire,
  creates the root with `a=t`, then emits every later full frame as `a=f,X=1`
  with **no `r=`**. New-frame continuations repeat `a=f` and still omit `r=`;
  `r=1` belongs to #196/#140's existing-root edit primitive above. Per-frame
  gaps are signed-32-bit milliseconds: zero means protocol gapless (`z=-1`) for
  later frames, while the root already defaults gapless and needs `a=a,r=1,z=`
  only for a positive gap. Mixed extents/formats refuse before any partial
  sequence; compressed bytes stay opaque/verbatim and every opaque transfer
  awaits its ordered reply. A registration owns one id in the shared 256-slot
  application-resident pool, is never implicitly deduplicated, and counts as
  one pinned residency root whose bytes sum every frame payload. Sink refusal,
  rejection, timeout, invalidation and shutdown follow the same accepted-write,
  rollback, quarantine and cleanup boundaries as pins. Basic `kitty_graphics`
  is insufficient: the base-owned support bit comes from the action-level
  probe or a pushed capability, and the non-pure default refuses with Warning.
- **Animation completion is commanded timeline state, not terminal truth**
  (#117). Kitty has start/stop/current-frame controls but no completion query.
  `play_animation` therefore takes explicit monotonic time, and App's protected
  wrapper supplies the same real or synthetic clock as its frame loop. Once is
  `s=2,c=1`; loop is `s=3,v=1,c=1`; an active Restart stops/selects frame 1
  before starting, while Ignore emits nothing. Hold interruption uses `s=1`;
  Finish uses `s=1,c=last`, so a cut-short transition lands on its authored end.
  Seek indices are zero-based in C++ and one-based on `c=`. The expected
  one-shot deadline sums gaps until the final frame becomes current and excludes
  that final frame's own gap; a loop has none. Controls carry no payload, count
  as `image_edit`, project state immediately, commit at the accepted-write
  boundary and roll back on sink refusal. Unregistration owns the sequence and
  therefore uses `d=I`, never placement-only `d=i`. The five driver additions
  are non-pure honest defaults; legacy and unsupported tiers return Warning.
- **Animation registration is not placement** (#301). The root transmitted by
  `register_animation` remains invisible until `draw_animation` places its
  resident image id. Its placement follows the same frame lifetime as a pinned
  placement: `retain_animation` keeps an unchanged placement live with zero
  bytes, omission uses `d=i` and leaves the sequence resident, and unregister
  remains the only path that owns enough to use `d=I`. Pins and animation roots
  share the placement-id allocator and placeholder collision rules because the
  wire sees the same `(image id, placement id)` identity. Their handles remain
  type-separated at the public boundary. Placement bookkeeping commits only at
  an accepted frame write; sink refusal restores the prior live placement so a
  later retain cannot remember bytes the terminal never received. Both virtual
  overload sets are non-pure compatibility additions.
- **Raw mode is RAII** — `Terminal` restores termios on destruction. Never
  leave the terminal in raw mode on any exit path, **including one an exception
  takes**: a destructor is not a guarantee (an exception escaping `main`
  terminates without unwinding), so `App::run_loop()` guards its loop and
  `App::teardown()` is the exact inverse of `App::setup()` — alt-screen, cooked
  mode, SIGWINCH, the resize registration. The fatal-signal backstop is for
  crashes, not for exceptions;
  if it is what restores your terminal, that is the bug (#71).
  **Enhanced keyboard teardown has an input barrier (#282).** On a normal or
  exception exit, disable the keyboard/mouse/paste input modes while the
  alternate screen is still active, then query `CSI ? u` and discard raw input
  through its ordered reply before the visual leave and `TCSAFLUSH` restore.
  This is what keeps a proxy-delayed release from becoming cooked shell input.
  The fixed-storage wait is bounded, skipped for known-unsupported terminals,
  and never reads after cooked mode returns. The fatal-signal path cannot poll;
  it retains the complete async-signal-safe `kLeaveSequence` as its backstop.
- **The fds are injectable, and the backstop follows the tty — not the
  `Terminal`** (#179). `Terminal::set_io` hands over the two streams instead of
  discovering stdin/stdout; it is base-owned non-virtual state for the same
  reason `set_output` is, and refusal is *total* — a half-applied pair is a
  session reading its own channel and writing somebody else's terminal.
  `enter_raw()` puts the input stream into the mode the loop **requires**:
  termios on a tty, `O_NONBLOCK` on anything else. That second half is not a
  nicety. `App::drain_input()` reads until a read comes back empty or the
  frame's shared 64-KiB/256-read fairness allowance is spent, and
  `set_read_timeout()` — the call that arranges nonblocking reads on a tty — is
  a silent no-op on a socket, so a "raw mode that does nothing" ships a hang
  rather than a limitation. The allowance is shared by normal decoding,
  replacement-mode discard and wait-phase absorption; spending it is not an
  input boundary, so parser and lone-ESC state carry into the next frame. The
  CSI/SS3 parser validates parameter, intermediate and final byte classes; an
  ESC inside an incomplete record retires only that prefix and is reprocessed
  as the next introducer, so one truncated control cannot consume or explode a
  valid replacement key (#318). **SGR wheel direction is lossless** (#319):
  codes 64/65 remain vertical up/down and 66/67 are horizontal left/right.
  `MouseEvent` keeps the legacy vertical projections and appends
  `scroll_left`/`scroll_right`; exactly one direction is valid when
  `button == -1`. Vertical widgets ignore horizontal reports, while generic
  modal/hover gates recognize every direction as `MouseAction::Wheel`. Trace
  schema 7 stores the axis in the last mouse flag bit and reuses the existing
  negative/positive direction bits, so schemas 1-6 stay byte-compatible.
  **A press-only `EventSource` is discrete**
  (#311): repeated Press events are independent actions, not held-state
  violations waiting for a Release the route cannot provide. App tracks source
  keys only when repeat or release was declared, synthesizes Release only when
  release was declared, and silently clears repeat-only tracking when that
  stateful capability disappears. Live validation and trace preflight carry
  the same rule. The refusal that remains is for a
  **discovered** non-tty stdin
  (`./app < file` is an accident); an injected one is a caller's deliberate
  choice, which is the whole discriminator.
  The crash backstop then arms in two halves with two predicates — termios when a
  real tty's termios was captured, the alt-screen when `out_fd` is a tty — and
  the nine signal handlers go in only with the first. A session that arms for no
  reason turns its own `SIGSEGV` into the whole server's, and leaves an fd
  *number* behind for the once-per-process `atexit` hook to write into long after
  that fd has been recycled. The handlers are borrowed process state too: the
  first lease captures each complete prior `sigaction`, the last restores it
  only while TermForge still owns that signal, and a newer handler is never
  overwritten during teardown (#193). **SIGWINCH has the same ownership
  contract independently** (#310): the first App lease captures and installs,
  overlapping Apps share the disposition, and only the final lease may restore
  the complete prior action while TermForge still owns it. The handler
  publishes a lock-free process resize generation rather than borrowing an
  `App*`; each leased App observes it on its loop thread, so teardown order
  cannot leave a dangling signal target. Installation failure owns no lease and
  surfaces one `Warning` through the App event channel. On the discovered path
  both predicates are
  tautologies (`out_fd` was chosen *by* `isatty`), which is exactly why nothing
  an existing program does changes by one byte.
  **The size is pushed too** (#180). `App::set_size` takes the dimensions the
  peer reported and the pull moves behind it: **pushed size → `TIOCGWINSZ` on the
  Terminal's `out` fd → 80×24**. A remote resize arrives as a protocol message,
  so there is no SIGWINCH to hook and no window to interrogate; the push
  therefore **arms the resize path** rather than touching the Screen, and one
  code path produces the Screen resize, the renderer invalidation, the cell
  geometry and the `ResizeEvent` whether a signal or a peer asked for it.
  Refusal is *total* like `set_io`'s and arms nothing. Its `<= 65535` guard is a
  **domain match, not a memory bound** — `winsize` holds unsigned shorts, so it
  refuses a window no ioctl could have reported; what an untrusted peer may
  claim is the embedding program's policy and stays there.
  **Identity is a push too** (#181). `Terminal::set_env` hands over the session's
  `TERM`/`COLORTERM` pair — a `pty-req` value the application has in hand and no
  way to hand over before — and injection is a statement of intent exactly like
  `set_io`'s: once the pair is handed over, the process environment is consulted
  for **neither field**. An empty string means "the client sent nothing", not
  "ask the daemon"; mixing the two sources per field would re-open the exact
  daemon/client gap the push closes. `query_capabilities()` and `is_console_vt()`
  are the only readers. Beside it, `set_capabilities` lets a caller that already
  knows the answer — a cached tier, a user override — hand it over, and
  `query_capabilities()` then serves the push having written **nothing** to the
  stream and read **nothing** from it: no probe bytes, no response window, no
  swallowed first keystrokes, and no `enter_raw()` on the push's behalf either.
  That is the override that survives a re-probe (`#145` item 3): every call serves
  the push until `clear_capabilities()` gives the probe back its job.

## Protocol priority (driver selection)

1. KittyDriver (flagship; Unicode placeholders for tmux are first-class) — **done**
2. SixelDriver (legacy fallback) — not yet implemented
3. AnsiRgbDriver (truecolor half-blocks, universal floor) — **done**
4. FallbackDriver (plain ASCII) — **done**
5. FramebufferDriver (optional, console-VT/embedded only) — cut

## Testing philosophy

**Test how code fails, not just the happy path.** For TermForge the failures
*are* the feature: malformed/truncated probe responses, escape-injection
sanitization, empty images, resize-mid-render, driver init failure surfacing
`ErrorEvent`. Happy-path assertions are smoke checks. Driver tests are
**offline** (render to an in-memory sink) — don't require a live TTY in unit
tests.

**Test the CALLER's call order, not the API's** (#187). A suite can be
exhaustive about *what* a unit does and blind to *when* its only real caller
does it. `gc_regions()` had ~90 assertions across four suites and none of them
saw that it deleted and re-uploaded every image every frame — because every one
of them drew before it flushed, and before #148 `App` flushed twice per frame
with the first flush having drawn nothing. So: **a flush is a write boundary,
not inherently a frame boundary**, and more generally, before trusting a suite,
check whether any case
makes the calls in the order production makes them. `test/47frameshape` is the
model — one suite whose entire subject is the caller's cadence, where a case
that draws before it flushes belongs somewhere else. When the harness cannot
reach the production path at all, say so **in the suite header**, treat the
replayed order as the limitation it is rather than as coverage — **and then
price the seam, because it is usually one parameter.** `test_wire_headless`
hardcoded a `FallbackDriver`, so no test could run `App`'s loop over the pixel
path; `test/44size` had already declined to add the injection point as "a new
test seam for one assertion", and #187 was the second customer and cost three
orders of magnitude more. #189 was two overloads and two delegating bodies.
`test/48apppixels` is what replay looks like once it is observation.

**Grep for tests that DEPEND on the bug before fixing it.** Two `test/46pinned`
cases drove an id counter using #187's per-frame allocation as a fixture. One
failed loudly when it was fixed; the other went **vacuous and stayed green**,
which is the dangerous one. A precondition asserted rather than assumed is what
made the first survivable — if a case rests on a defect, `REQUIRE` the defect so
its removal breaks the case instead of hollowing it.

**A proof about state is not a proof about reachability** (#187). The safety
argument for that fix was that the one state write it skipped was provably a
self-assignment, so every reader of that variable saw identical values. Sound —
and it missed that the change also altered *what was in two maps*, and that two
guards read those maps. Both had a frame-window clause that had been dead under
`App`'s order (the old code emptied the maps before the guards could see them)
and was now the only thing preventing a false refusal. **When a change alters the
contents of a container, enumerate the predicates that read that container**, not
only the ones that read the variables you reasoned about.

**When an invariant becomes structural, its guards go with it** (#190). Bounding
region ids to their own pool made two #109 guards unreachable — the region
allocator's step-over-pinned-ids loop and `pin_image`'s scan of the region map.
Both were deleted, because a guard that cannot fire is a fault in the *code*,
and one that advertises a hazard the code no longer has is worse than absent:
the next reader goes looking for the bug it implies. **Test the invariant, never
the dead guard.** Be precise about what replaced them: the `static_assert`
orders the two *ranges* and is a necessary condition, but it is compile-time
over two constants and cannot observe an allocator — the invariant is carried at
runtime by the walk's own bound and the eviction branch, and covered by
`test/49regionids`. Do not let a `static_assert` take credit for a loop.

The exceptions are where the judgement lives, so treat the list as open rather
than closed — #190 hit three in one cut:

- A branch that **totalizes a function over its parameter's own type** is not
  this shape. `emit_id_as_sgr`'s 24-bit form is unreachable for every id the
  driver allocates and stays, because `std::uint32_t` is wider than the
  invariant and the alternative is emitting a malformed `38;5;300`.
- A guard whose deletion would let control **fall through into the corruption it
  names** is not this shape. `pin_image`'s refusal was kept and *merged* with the
  size check above it, which turned out to be the same predicate over the same
  map computed twice.
- A bound that **is the algorithm's own termination** is not this shape, even
  though no input reaches it. `region_slot`'s walk stops at `kMaxRegionSlots`
  and the pigeonhole makes that id free whenever the walk lands there, so
  deleting the bound is behaviourally invisible today and mutation-survives. It
  stays: it is what makes the range a property of the loop instead of an
  argument made in a comment, and it is the line the two deletions above rest on.

**The same rule applies to TESTS, and that cost a case.** When the coupling a
test existed to check becomes structural, the test stops being able to fail —
and a green test reads as coverage in a way a deleted guard does not. #190
deleted `test/46pinned`'s "a pin never takes an id a live region is holding"
after **two** re-pointings that were each verified vacuous by mutation rather
than by eye. Re-point a case only if you can name a mutation it still kills;
otherwise delete it, and say why where it stood.

**A rate claim is a claim; measure it** (#190). "This counter climbs per churn
event, so it matters over a long session" was derived correctly from the code and
was off by three orders of magnitude, because for moving content a churn event
*is* a frame. It reached the ceiling in four seconds, not eventually. Fifty lines
of scratch program settled what a paragraph of reasoning got wrong, and the wrong
number had already been published in an issue.

## How to verify before a PR

```bash
cmake -B build && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
cmake -B build-clang -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain/clang.cmake \
  && cmake --build build-clang && ctest --test-dir build-clang
```

Both compilers must build clean and pass. **Terminal-protocol changes also
need empirical verification on real emulators** (Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm,
Konsole, xterm, GNOME Terminal, a bare TTY) — the agent can't see a terminal,
so a human runs the probe and reports the bytes. Pin the `Capabilities` schema
against real responses before it becomes load-bearing.

## Notes for agents

- **Path caution:** some environments' editing tools write relative to the
  session's original root, not the shell cwd. Prefer shell writes (`run`) in a
  freshly-`cp`'d repo, or verify the target tree after `write_file`.
- The Pimpl in `Terminal` keeps termios/POSIX details out of the public
  header — keep it that way.
- Build dirs (`build*/`) are gitignored.
