# There are some potential business rules here
#  Ultimately the idea is to ease release and not need commits just to roll a version
# Also, when there is a version.hpp.in file, this need valid values for compile
#  which has an effect on dev build test cycle for a developer

# TERMFORGE_VERSION, not a bare VERSION: under add_subdirectory this file runs
# in a scope that inherits the consumer's variables, and a parent project's
# stray `VERSION` would silently become termforge's project version (the
# fallback below would never fire). A packager building from a git-less tarball
# can pin it with -DTERMFORGE_VERSION=x.y.z.

  # a repository that merely contains us. Vendor termforge as a plain directory
  # inside another project (external/termforge/, not a submodule) and describe
  # returns the *consumer's* tag, which project() would then report as
  # termforge's version -- v9.9.9 of some app becomes termforge 9.9.9.
  #
  # Every arrangement whose tags are actually ours puts the repository top
  # level exactly here: a dev clone, a submodule (.git file, still its own
  # repo) and FetchContent's _deps/termforge-src (a real clone). So ask which
  # repo git resolved to and only trust the tag when the answer is us.
