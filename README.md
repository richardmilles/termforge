# TermForge

A lightweight, modular **terminal UI framework in C++23**, BSD 3-clause
licensed. It renders pixel graphics inline in the terminal using
terminal-native protocols — **Kitty Terminal Graphics Protocol (TGP) first,
ANSI truecolor half-blocks as the universal floor**, with plain-ASCII
degradation for bare TTYs. A Sixel driver (legacy fallback) and an optional
framebuffer driver (console-VT/embedded) are on the roadmap but not yet
implemented.

A distinguishing feature: degradation and failure (e.g. a graphics fallback)
are **events**, queryable and loggable via `std::expected` / `std::variant` —
applications are never silently downgraded.

Dependency policy: **standard library only** in the shipped library. Catch2
for tests.

## Status

Core framework, KittyDriver, the widget system, mouse routing, and the
`forge-top` dogfooding application are landed and tested across 78 CTest targets;
GCC 13/14 + Clang 19/20 are green in CI, ASan/UBSan is clean, and the
cross-thread event path has a focused TSan gate.

Landed and verified:
- **Core** — value types (`Cell`/`Image`, `Capabilities`, `Event`/`ErrorEvent`
  variant), `Screen` (cell grid + sanitize boundary), `Renderer` (diff-render
  with color pass-through), `Input` (escape state machine, UTF-8, SGR mouse,
  kitty CSI-u key reports with press/repeat/release — see
  [docs/keyboard-protocol.md](docs/keyboard-protocol.md)),
  `App` (event loop, SIGWINCH resize, explicit resident-image invalidation on
  suspend/reattach/reset, pixel-region plumbing, guarded teardown
  on every exit path including an exception, thread-safe `post(Event)`
  delivery onto the loop thread, and owned structured `EventSource` adapters
  with explicit terminal replacement/composition). Apps can request
  `BuiltinDriver::{Kitty,AnsiRgb,Fallback}` before `run()` without fabricating
  probe facts, and inspect the selected tier through `driver().name()`.
  Terminal input, structured
  source batches, one posted-event snapshot, and ticks have a documented
  order; widgets and every other App API remain single-threaded. See
  [docs/event-sources.md](docs/event-sources.md).
- `Terminal` — raw-mode RAII (termios restore on destruction, or explicitly via
  `leave_raw()` where no destructor is guaranteed to run), capability
  probing (Kitty query + DA1, Sixel attribute, truecolor env), automatic or
  explicit built-in driver selection, read-mode API, alt-screen lifecycle.
- **KittyDriver** — Kitty graphics protocol: base64 + APC transmit, classic
  cursor placement, Unicode placeholders (tmux-first), stable per-region image
  IDs with LRU eviction, and semantic above-text/below-text/below-background
  image layers. Flagship driver.
- **AnsiRgbDriver** — truecolor half-block rendering with SGR run-coalescing.
- **FallbackDriver** — plain-ASCII luminance, the bare-TTY floor.
- **Widgets** — `Widget` base (with immediate and persistent pixel-region
  support), `PixelSurface` (an owned, fixed-resolution software framebuffer
  with producer-directed dirty submission and an ASCII cell fallback),
  TextBox scrollback, Composer multiline input/history, TableWidget,
  ListWidget, WaveformWidget, MapWidget (tile
  maps: TileSet + camera + layers + a persistent atlas-sprite tier), and the
  primitives Label, Button, ProgressBar, TextInput, Frame, MenuBar, TabBar.
  Mouse event routing via
  `Widget::hit_test` (topmost-first); `FocusRing` owns the Tab order.
  The scrollable three paint a shared one-column scrollbar (track + thumb,
  click-to-page-jump) when their content overflows, so a viewport never hides
  that there's more (`widgets/detail/scrollbar.hpp`).
- **TabBar** — a horizontal strip of titles that reports which one is active
  (`on_change(int)`); Left/Right and clicks switch it, and the strip scrolls
  with `‹ ›` indicators when the titles outrun the columns. It owns the strip
  and nothing else — swapping the content below it stays the app's job (see
  `examples/widgets.cpp`).
- **Form controls** — `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup` (one tab stop for the whole
  group, arrows move the selection) and `Select` (a dropdown that closes on
  focus loss, and closes-then-declines Tab so one press both dismisses it and
  moves on). See `examples/forms.cpp`.
- **Glyph families** — `widgets/glyphs.hpp` is the single place line and mark
  glyphs are chosen: five border families (`Single`/`Double`/`Rounded`/
  `Heavy`/`Ascii`), matching interior-grid lines, and form-control marks, so an
  app on the bare-TTY tier switches every frame, divider, and control to 7-bit
  ASCII with one enum.
- **Modal dialogs** — an overlay stack in `App` that draws last and captures
  all input, plus `MessageDialog` / `ConfirmDialog` / `PromptDialog` that size
  and center themselves, `ChoiceDialog` for single/multiple choice with an
  optional free-form answer, `ChoiceWizardDialog` for validated Back/Next flows
  that preserve every page's answers, and `FilePickerDialog`, a modal file
  browser composed from those pieces (path field + dirs-first listing +
  OK/Cancel) with permission errors surfaced as a nested dialog. See
  `docs/modal-overlays.md`.
- **Simulation split** — `App::on_tick(dt)` advances state, `on_render` only
  draws, so motion is measured in seconds rather than in frames and runs at the
  same speed at any frame budget. Variable `dt` by default; `set_tick_hz(n)`
  switches to a fixed timestep for deterministic, replayable physics, and the
  `set_max_tick_dt` clamp keeps a stall from teleporting objects through walls.
  A borrowed `SyntheticClock` installed with `App::set_clock` advances frame
  waits without sleeping; combine it with a fixed tick rate and a disabled
  stall clamp for exact, wall-time-free application tests. The protected
  clock/readiness/input seams remain available for custom scripted sources.
  `start_recording` / `stop_recording` capture raw input chunks, structured
  source events, effective input capabilities, resize and posted-event timing;
  `play` feeds the artifact back through the production decoder and frame loop
  under recorded capabilities. See
  [docs/input-traces.md](docs/input-traces.md).
  `RenderMode::Demand` is an opt-in idle policy: input, posts, resizes,
  overlays, and `request_render()` coalesce into one render, then the loop
  blocks at zero draw/flush work after the first tick that requests nothing.
  Continuous rendering remains the default. An animation calls
  `request_render()` from each `on_tick()` that changed visible state; an
  off-thread producer keeps using the thread-safe `post(Event)` wake path.
  Widgets get the same hook — `Widget::on_tick(dt)`, forwarded by the app with
  `tick_widgets(dt, {…})`, or a `std::vector<Widget*>` when they live in a
  container — so a ProgressBar's pulse and a Button's press flash are measured
  in seconds too. See `examples/motion.cpp`.
- **`forge-top`** — the default binary is a live `/proc` monitor with top-shaped
  uptime/load/task summaries, aggregate or per-core waveforms with responsive
  style-matched grid dividers, consistently scaled memory bars, and a
  responsive sortable/filterable process table with
  `PID USER S %CPU %MEM TIME+ RES COMMAND`. A persistent pixel process graph
  remains one Enter away. `--fake` supplies deterministic data and
  `--driver=kitty|ansi|fallback` forces each rendering tier.

Deferred per the roadmap: `SixelDriver` (Epic 5), the broader benchmark
workloads, framebuffer driver.

## Why

- `ncurses` — no graphics story, dated API.
- `notcurses` — the feature benchmark, but drags a multimedia dependency tree.
- `FTXUI` — modern C++, but cells only, no pixel graphics.

TermForge's pitch: **notcurses-class inline graphics with a stdlib-only,
C++23-native API.**

| | Graphics | Deps | API |
|---|---|---|---|
| ncurses | none | none | C, dated |
| notcurses | Kitty/Sixel/blocks | heavy | C |
| FTXUI | none (cells only) | none | modern C++ |
| **TermForge** | **Kitty today; Sixel planned** | **none** | **C++23** |

## Build & test

```bash
cmake -B build && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
# cross-compiler (clang opt-in):
cmake -B build-clang -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain/clang.cmake \
  && cmake --build build-clang && ctest --test-dir build-clang
```

Sanitizer builds route through toolchain files (they actually apply the
flags): `cmake/toolchain/address.cmake`, `cmake/toolchain/thread.cmake`.

C++ formatting is pinned to clang-format 20.x. Run `tools/format.sh --check`
to check the complete tracked C++ tree or `tools/format.sh --fix` to apply the
policy. The selected LLVM-derived options and their rationale are documented
in [docs/code-style.md](docs/code-style.md).

Static analysis is pinned to clang-tidy 20.x. Run `tools/lint.sh` to configure
and check the shipped library with the same focused policy as CI. Its scope and
rationale are documented in [docs/static-analysis.md](docs/static-analysis.md).

Performance evidence is a separate, Release-only developer target. It emits a
human table or schema-versioned JSON and never fails on a timing threshold:

```bash
cmake -B build-bench -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Dtermforge_BENCH=ON
cmake --build build-bench -j4 --target termforge_bench termforge_terminal_bench \
  termforge_shm_bench
./build-bench/bench/termforge_bench --format json --output benchmark.json
```

Use `--suite kernels|w3|all`, `--samples N`, `--warmup N`, or `--smoke` to
select the run. The W3 sweep records cell-rendering walls at 16.6 and 33.3 ms;
results describe the named host/compiler and are not portable guarantees.
`termforge_terminal_bench` adds W5's direct-pty Kitty/Ghostty/xterm stress
matrix; launch it through `tools/w5_capture.sh` from the terminal under test.
`termforge_shm_bench` compares Kitty's direct and explicitly enabled POSIX
shared-memory startup upload paths from the same local terminal namespace.
See [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md).

Applications can collect the same rendered-frame byte breakdown together with
tick, render, framework-submission, and blocking sink-write wall time through
`App::set_frame_observer`. Observation is opt-in; without a callback TermForge
does not take the additional timing stamps. The sink interval ends when the
configured output accepts or refuses the frame—it does not claim when a
terminal decodes or presents it.

## Using TermForge in your project

TermForge is stdlib-only — there are no transitive dependencies to satisfy.
Both paths below give you the same target, `termforge::lib`, and build **only**
the library: the demo binary, examples and tests default OFF whenever TermForge
is not the top-level project, no Catch2 is fetched, and TermForge never touches
your `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` or `CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`.

### find_package first, FetchContent as fallback (recommended)

```cmake
find_package(termforge CONFIG QUIET)

if (NOT termforge_FOUND)
  include(FetchContent)
  FetchContent_Declare(termforge
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/gobha-me/termforge.git
    GIT_TAG        v0.1.7
  )
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(termforge)
endif ()

target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE termforge::lib)
```

### add_subdirectory (vendored / sibling checkout)

```cmake
add_subdirectory(external/termforge)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE termforge::lib)
```

### Installing

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -Dtermforge_TESTS=OFF -Dtermforge_EXAMPLES=OFF -Dtermforge_BIN=OFF
cmake --build build -j
cmake --install build --prefix /usr/local
```

Headers land in `${prefix}/include/termforge/`, the package config in
`${prefix}/lib/cmake/termforge/`. Building from a source tarball with no git
history yields version `0.0.0.1`; packagers can pin it with
`-DTERMFORGE_VERSION=x.y.z`.

| option | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `termforge_TESTS` | ON at top level, else OFF | Catch2 test suite (also honours `BUILD_TESTING`) |
| `termforge_EXAMPLES` | ON at top level, else OFF | the `examples/` demos |
| `termforge_BIN` | ON at top level, else OFF | the `forge-top` system-monitor binary |
| `termforge_INSTALL` | ON at top level, else OFF | generate `install()`/`export()` rules |
| `termforge_BENCH` | OFF | Release-only performance evidence harness |

Both consumption paths are exercised in CI by `tools/consume/run.sh`, on GCC
and Clang.

## Demos

- `src/bin` — `forge-top`, a live `/proc` system monitor and permanent
  all-driver dogfooding harness. Under a non-TTY it exits cleanly with
  "stdin/stdout is not a tty" — the failure path working as designed.
- `examples/` — focused demos per subsystem: `game` (a deterministic 320×180
  workload with headless benchmark and real-Kitty capture modes),
  `pixel_surface` (the persistent framebuffer primitive), `dashboard`
  (TableWidget + WaveformWidget + TextBox), `motion` (`on_tick` — fixed vs
  variable timestep and the stall clamp, live), `widgets` (all primitives +
  focus model), `dialogs` (single-page and wizard compositions), `image`,
  `chat` (TextBox + Composer), `input`, `colors`, `low_level`, `hello`.

The game workload can be measured without a TTY or captured on a real Kitty
terminal. See [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) for commands, metric
definitions, and the current baseline.

Run the monitor against deterministic data or force a rendering tier:

```bash
./build/src/bin/forge-top --fake
./build/src/bin/forge-top --fake --driver=kitty
./build/src/bin/forge-top --fake --driver=ansi
./build/src/bin/forge-top --fake --driver=fallback
```

The monitor accepts the familiar top keys: `P/M/N/T` choose the sort field,
`R` reverses it, `d` or `s` changes the sampling delay, `1` switches aggregate
and per-CPU views, `l/t/m` toggle summary sections, `c` switches command name
and full command line, Space samples immediately, and `q` quits. `h`, `?`, or
F1 opens the complete on-screen key guide. Tab moves focus; arrows, Page
Up/Down, and Home/End navigate the table and menus. Enter deliberately opens a
process graph instead of refreshing, table headers sort, and Escape closes a
popup or exits. The old chat-scrollback program remains available as
`termforge_example_chat`.

## Design notes

- **Capability detection queries the terminal**, never the display server —
  `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`$DISPLAY` say nothing about what the attached emulator
  can render. Probe = Kitty graphics query + DA1, then Sixel attribute, then
  truecolor env corroboration.
- **Escape sanitization** is the renderer's job: drivers emit bytes verbatim,
  so any user-/network-sourced text must be stripped of C0/C1/ESC before it
  reaches a driver (injection prevention). Validation rejects overlong UTF-8
  (e.g. an overlong ESC) and surrogate encodings, not just malformed bytes.
- **Runtime polymorphism** for drivers (`std::unique_ptr<TerminalDriver>`)
  because the driver set is open to third-party implementations; the
  `DriverImpl` concept is a `static_assert` conformance check only.

See `AGENTS.md` for contributor/agent conventions and the testing philosophy.
