// several at once. `Cell` is stored per grid position and compared every
// frame by the diff renderer, so the attribute is packed into one byte and
// the equality is the default memberwise compare.
//
// These are the attributes a terminal can express that color alone cannot:
//   * Dim       — the semantic tool for a disabled/inactive control.
//   * Reverse   — how selection is conventionally drawn; theme-independent,
//                 unlike the fg/bg swap widgets currently hand-roll.
//   * Underline — the accepted affordance for a link / menu accelerator.
// On the low-color / FallbackDriver tier, attributes are the *only* channel
// left once color is gone, which makes this a degradation-story feature, not
// just expressiveness.
//

// once and then moves the sprites around re-transmits payloads it already
// sent -- silently, and at a cost (205,283 bytes for the plate #163 measured)
// that no API told it about. A pinned image is exempt from that cache
// entirely: it lives until unpin_image, wherever it is drawn and however many
// other images exist.
//
// OPAQUE. `id` is the terminal-side image id and `owner` says which driver
// issued it; neither is a number to compute with. Compare handles, do not
// construct them -- a default-constructed one is the empty handle, which every
